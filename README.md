# Search Algorithms

**Uninformed search algorithms**
- [x] BFS - Breadth-first search
- [x] DFS - Depth-first search
- [x] UCS - form Cost Search  - 
- [x] ITS - Iterative-deepening Search 
- [x] DLS - Depth-Limited Search 

**Informed search algorithms**
- [x] Greedy
- [x] A*

STEPS:
1. Build a graph
2. Select the start state and final state(s)
3. Select the search algorithm (Uninfored and Informed)
4. Press start
5. Repeat
